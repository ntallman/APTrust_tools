# Tools to Bag DSpace Content for the APTrust Preservation Repository

These tools may be used to process bags produced by the DSpace Replication Task Suite into bags that conform to the APTrust bag specification. Each item, community, and collection is stored in it's own bag; community and collection bags are the container themselves and do not include child content.

In order to push bags to your APTrust receiving bucket, you must have configured your AWS keyes. It operates under the premise that you have already established your AWS keys.
