# APTrust_tools

These tools are to assist in the bagging and sending of digital content to APTrust. It operates under the premise that you have already established your AWS keys.

These tools were designed to work with content exported from DSpace with the Replication Task Suite. Each item, community, and collection will be a seperate object.
